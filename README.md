1. Follow AIY Voice Kit setup instructions
2. Add and start a service using the Python in this repository on the AIY Voice Kit.
3. Use Android Studio or similar to install the Android Application from this repository to a phone.
4. You will need to run on a shared local network (ie: a hotspot from the phone) between the application and the voice kit and modify the IP address in the Android Application accordingly.
5. You can request the IP Address from the AIY Voice Kit via "OK Google, IP Address", or logging into the Raspberry Pi kernel.
6. Once running, use a phrase containing the word "dance" and one of the 5 preset dances, ie: "Hey Google, Do the marshmallow dance", or "OK Google, dance like Iconic".
7. The phone application should update to reflect the latest dance
